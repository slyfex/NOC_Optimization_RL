# NOC Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

## Problem Statement
To design an efficient NOC for a SoC considering various workloads, optimizing for latency, bandwidth, area, and power.

## Approach
1. Pseudocode Development: Measure latency and bandwidth using simulator output.
2. Reinforcement Learning Framework: Optimize NOC parameters using RL, defining states, actions, and rewards.

## Validation
Ensure correctness through simulation result comparison and parameter convergence testing.

## Complexity Analysis
Analyze time and space complexity, ensuring efficient pseudocode and RL framework.

## Alternatives Considered
Considered heuristic-based and genetic algorithms, but chose RL for adaptive learning and potential optimal solutions.
